# RockPaperScissor

This program is a basic Rock–Paper–Scissors game made using the C language. The user chooses Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer also picks one option randomly. After that, the program checks who wins.

# How the Game Works

The player enters a number:

1 = Rock

2 = Paper

3 = Scissors

The computer also selects a number between 1 and 3 using rand().

Both choices are shown on the screen.

The program then compares both choices and prints whether:

the match is a Draw,

the player Wins, or

the player Loses.

# How to Run

1. Compile the program using a C compiler (like GCC).


3. Run the file.


4. Enter your choice (1–3).


5. See the result of the GAME.
